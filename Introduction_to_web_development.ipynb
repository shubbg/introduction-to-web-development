        "\n",
        "  ->1. Client\n",
        " What it is: The user's device (like a phone, computer, or app).\n",
        "\n",
        " Function: It sends requests to the server to get data or perform some action.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: When you open YouTube and click on a video, your browser (client) sends a request to the YouTube server.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.Server\n",
        " What it is: A powerful computer that stores data and programs.\n",
        "\n",
        " Function: It receives requests from the client, processes them, and sends back a response.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: YouTube’s server sends you the video and comments when you request them.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.Network (Internet)\n",
        " What it is: The connection between client and server (usually the internet).\n",
        "\n",
        " Function: It helps send and receive messages (requests and responses) between the client and server.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: Your Wi-Fi or mobile data lets your device talk to the server.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.Database (on the server)\n",
        " What it is: A place where data is stored and organized.\n",
        "\n",
        " Function: It saves data like user accounts, messages, files, etc., and allows the server to fetch or update them when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: When you log in, the server checks your username/password in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.Application (Software)\n",
        " What it is: The code or program running on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        " Function: It processes the client’s request, does the logic, and prepares a response.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: If you search “cat videos,” the server software finds matching videos and sends the list to your screen.\n",
